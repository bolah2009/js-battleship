        <p class="text">
          The game is played on two grids, one is the Ocean Grid and the other is the Target Grid.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          On one grid (Ocean Grid) the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent.
          On the other grid (Target Grid), the player records their shots.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Before play begins, the player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each
          ship occupies some consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or
          vertically. <br />
          The arrangement can be randomised using the <strong>Randomise</strong> button or be placed
          manually using the <strong>Place ships</strong> button and using drag and drop to place
          ships on the grid horizontally. Clicking on a ship rotates the position vertically when in
          horizontal poition and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships
          cannot overlap, that is, only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid and ships
          can not be placed beside each other.<br />
        </p>

          After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds when the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button is clicked. The <strong>Reset Game</strong> button can
          be clicked at any time during the game to stop and restart the game.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          In each round, each player takes a turn to click on a target square in the opponent's grid
          which is to be shot at. The attacking player "target" grid is marked with red for "hit",
          black for "miss".<br />

          If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.<br />
